# qapital-backend-test
Test task for backend developers

## Introduction
This is a code skeleton for a test task for backend developer candidates seeking to join Qapital.

The code skeleton consists of a functional Spring Boot application that contains logic for applying Savings Rules for a user, given some hardcoded bank transaction data and settings. The task is to implement certain missing pieces of the application, and by doing so demonstrate an understanding of the technologies involved and how to structure code in a well-thought-out way.

To complete the task, clone this repository, implement your solution and submit a link or zipped repository for review.

While we don't require the solution to be perfect, we do expect it to be written in a professional manner. You should use this opportunity to show us what kind of code you would write if we were to employ you.

## Basic Domain Concepts

### Transaction
A [Transaction](src/main/java/com/qapital/bankdata/transaction/Transaction.java) represents a bank transaction on a bank account. It has basic properties such as amount, description and date. Debits such as card expenses have negative amounts, Credits such as income have positive amounts.

### SavingsRule
A [SavingsRule](src/main/java/com/qapital/savings/rule/SavingsRule.java) is an automated savings configuration that saves money for a user based on certain settings and the transactions read for that user. 

### SavingsGoal
A Savings Goal is not explicitely modeled as a class in this skeleton, but represents something (eg. a trip or item) that a user is saving towards.

### SavingsEvent
A [SavingsEvent](src/main/java/com/qapital/savings/event/SavingsEvent.java) is an event in the history of a Savings Goal. In this task it is the result of an execution of a SavingsRule on a particular Transaction, for a particular SavingsGoal.

## Task Specification

1. Implement the method **executeRule()** in [StandardSavingsRulesService](src/main/java/com/qapital/savings/rule/StandardSavingsRulesService.java). The method should load the latest transactions for the user using the TransactionsService and apply the given SavingsRule to those transactions. The result is a list of SavingsEvents. If a rule is configured for more than one SavingsGoal, the saved amount should be split equally amongst the goals.
   Note that there are two different RuleTypes: **The Roundup Rule** and the **Guilty Pleasure Rule**. The implementation should handle both types. Both of these rules should only be applied to expense transactions.

   1.1. The Roundup Rule: When the Roundup Rule is applied to a transaction, it rounds the amount on the transaction to the nearest multiple of the configured roundup amount and generates a SavingsEvent with the difference as the saved amount. I.e., for a transaction of $3.55 with a Roundup Rule configured to round up to the nearest $2.00, the saved amount is $0.45. For a transaction of $2.55, with an identically configured amount, the roundup would be $1.45.

   1.2. The Guilty Pleasure Rule: When the Guilty Pleasure Rule is applied to a transaction, it should check that the configured description matches the transaction's description. If so, the configured amount is saved.
   
2. Create an endpoint method in [SavingsRulesController](src/main/java/com/qapital/savings/rule/SavingsRulesController.java) that takes a SavingsRule object as a JSON body, calls the executeRule() method implemented above and returns the list of SavingsEvents as a JSON body. Any dates in the JSON objects must be expressed as strings in the ISO 8601 format.

You are free to add any support classes you feel are necessary or would make the solution better, as well as to refactor existing supporting code as long as the above requirements are met. You may also add any third party dependencies you feel are motivated.
